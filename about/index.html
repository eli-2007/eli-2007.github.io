                    I'm Eli and I have always been fascinated by technology, which made me begin programming back in 2018.
                    Over time, I have developed my skills and have learned a multitude of languages and frameworks.
                    I was unable to study Computer Science at GCSE level, so I taught myself how to program in my spare time.
                    I then progressed to taking a Level 3 Course in Computer Science at college, which I am currently studying.
                    I also have an aptitude for Photography, which I studied at GCSE level, and can take interesting photos.
