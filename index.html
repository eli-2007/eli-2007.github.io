                        I'm Eli and I have always been fascinated by technology, which made me begin programming back in 2018.
                        Over time, I have developed my skills and have learned a multitude of languages and frameworks.
                        I also have taught myself how to use Git and GitHub, which is where I host all of my projects.
                        I am also able to use Linux and have an understanding of how it works, similarly to how I am able to set up and deploy devices with new operating systems and applications.

                        I have made a variety of projects over time, ranging from websites to Java plugins.
                        I have also programmed some projects in Python and JavaScript, which are both languages I am familiar with.
                        I can use my developing HTML and CSS skills to create websites like this one.
                        I have also made a few different Node JS applications, which I have built and tested locally and some are deployed.
                        I have also made a few Java plugins for Minecraft servers, and a Minecraft Java PvP client, which I have also built and tested locally and some have been utilised by larger Minecraft creators.
